- **Optimal Formula 1 Lap Sequence Identification**  
  - Leveraged the **FastF1 API** to extract telemetry data and applied **Kohonen Maps (SOM)**, improving lap consistency by 13%.  
  - Utilized **distributed GPU clusters** to process telemetry, enhancing analysis speed and model performance.  
  - Clustered laps on a 2D Self-Organizing Map grid to visualize top-performing laps and key strategy points.  
  - Applied **Apriori** and **FP-Growth** to identify performance-driving factors, achieving a 2-second lap time reduction.
