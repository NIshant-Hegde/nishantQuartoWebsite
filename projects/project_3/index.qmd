- **Wafer Map Failure Pattern Detection**  
  - Engineered 40+ spatial features (density histograms, localized geometric descriptors), improving pattern separability by 25%.
  - Incorporated semi-supervised learning with SHAP and t-SNE for interpretable anomaly detection under 70% label scarcity.
  - Leveraged stacked meta-models combining SVM and LightGBM, achieving 92% classification accuracy across five major wafer
map failure patterns.
