### Project Summary

- **Cryptographic Neural Nets on Homomorphically Encrypted Data**
  - Developed machine learning models capable of training on encrypted data to enhance data privacy and security while still enabling advanced machine learning applications.
  - Experimented with different homomorphic encryption schemes such as Brakerski-Gentry-Vaikuntanathan (BGV) and Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song (CKKS) to encrypt images. Utilized Microsoftâ€™s SEAL library to implement BGV and CKKS schemes.
  - Proposed an alternative way of achieving homomorphic data encryption by using autoencoders. Classified encrypted data using a custom CNN and achieved 70% accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
